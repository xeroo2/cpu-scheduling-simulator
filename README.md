A console-based C++ program that simulates four popular CPU scheduling algorithms:

- Shortest Job Next (SJN)
- Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling (NPP)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)

## ðŸ›  Features

- Supports both preemptive and non-preemptive algorithms
- Gantt Chart display for visualization
- Calculates and displays:
  - Turnaround Time
  - Waiting Time
  - Average metrics
- Handles CPU idle times
- Clean and modular code structure
